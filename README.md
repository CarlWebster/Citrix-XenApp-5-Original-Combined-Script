# Citrix-XenApp-5-Original-Combined-Script
Creates a complete inventory of a Citrix XenApp 5 farm using Microsoft Word.

The original 1.xx script used plain text output only.
The V2.xx script moved to Word output.

This is the first documentation script I created. I was learning PowerShell for each line of code written. I had access to a XenApp 5 on Server 2003 Farm and James Rankin (in England) had access to a XenApp 5 on Server 2008 Farm. I would create a section of the report and James would tell me what needed added or moved around or wording changed for 2008. It was a fun process coding for XA5/2008 totally blind.

A bit of history.
The first script was the XenApp 5 script.
Second was XenApp 6.0.
Third was XenApp 6.5.
Fourth was XenDesktop 4.
Fifth was PVS.
