# Citrix-XenApp-5-Original-Combined-Script
Creates a complete inventory of a Citrix XenApp 5 farm using Microsoft Word.

The original 1.xx script used plain text output only.
The V2.xx script moved to Word output.

This is the first documentation script I created. I was learning PowerShell for each line of code written. I had access to a XenApp 5 on Server 2003 Farm and James Rankin (in England) had access to a XenApp 5 on Server 2008 Farm. I would create a section of the report and James would tell me what needed added or moved around or wording changed for 2008. It was a fun process coding for XA5/2008 totally blind.

A bit of history.
The first script was the XenApp 5 script.
The second was XenApp 6.0.
The third was XenApp 6.5.
The fourth was XenDesktop 4.
The fifth was PVS.

As of 13-May-2020, there are 27 documentation scripts and 32 other scripts and files available for download on https://lnkd.in/eKZ7dJF

There would have been no scripts released without the encouragement of Jarian Gibson & the patience of my main teacher, mentor, & friend Michael B. Smith.

Many people were involved in the scripts over the years. It all started with a blog post by Michael Bogobowicz.
